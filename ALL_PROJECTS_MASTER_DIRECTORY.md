================================================================================
```
* **Title:** Yokoso — Cinematic Scroll-Driven 3D Kyoto Temple Portfolio
* **Local Path:** `D:\ProjectsGit\Portfolio\kageOP2`
* **GitHub Repository:** [https://github.com/RezZup/Yokoso](https://github.com/RezZup/Yokoso)
* **Live Deployment:** [https://rezzup.github.io/Yokoso/](https://rezzup.github.io/Yokoso/)
* **Domain:** Creative Development • WebGL • 3D Graphics • Front-End Engineering

#### 📖 Description
Yokoso is an immersive, single-page portfolio designed as a five-chapter night walk through an atmospheric Kyoto mountain temple. Instead of abrupt page jumps or standard flat layouts, the entire site is rendered as a continuous, full-viewport WebGL scene where scrolling dynamically drives the camera along a 3D bezier trajectory through torii gates, stone stairs, lantern-lit walkways, and temple courtyards.

Every element of the 3D environment — the temple structure, tiered roofs, stone lanterns with flame glows, misty mountainous terrain, falling rain, drifting sakura blossom petals, volumetric fog, and the vermilion full moon — is procedurally synthesized directly in code (Three.js shaders and geometry) without requiring external 3D model files (.gltf / .obj). Each portfolio project card features an interactive mini-viewport that dynamically renders a real-time 3D Three.js scene upon hover.

#### 🌟 Key Features
- **Procedural 3D World:** Zero 3D model asset dependencies. Temple pagodas, torii, lanterns, terrain, fog, rain, sakura petals, and moon generated in code.
- **Scroll-Driven Camera Path:** Continuous bezier camera journey powered by Lenis smooth scrolling.

* **Domain:** Machine Learning • Time-Series Forecasting • Explainable AI (XAI)

#### 📖 Description
Conventional air quality forecasting models often suffer from temporal data leakage due to random train/test splitting, creating overly optimistic metrics that fail in production. This project implements a rigorous, leakage-safe machine learning pipeline trained on 29,531 daily observation records across 26 major Indian cities over 5 years (2015–2020) from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).

The pipeline enforces strict chronological 80/20 train/test splitting per city, temporal interpolation, and rolling-window feature engineering (lag values, 7-day rolling means, min/max metrics). Benchmark evaluations compare Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. An Isolation Forest model identifies anomalous pollution spikes (industrial emissions, stubble burning), while SHAP provides model explainability through global summary plots and single-day waterfall charts.

#### 🌟 Key Features & Metrics
- **Leakage-Safe Chronological Partitioning:** Eliminates future-to-past data leakage across 29,531 records and 26 Indian cities.
- **Model Performance:** Random Forest achieved **RMSE: 49.96** and **R²: 0.681** for next-day AQI prediction.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Isolation Forest identified **1,243 anomalies (5.0%)**, isolating seasonal pollution crises and industrial events.
- **Explainable AI (XAI):** SHAP summary, importance, and waterfall plots verified that PM2.5 and 7-day rolling AQI are the strongest predictive drivers of severe air quality.
- **Comprehensive Visualizations:** Correlation matrices, seasonal pollutant breakdowns, and actual-vs-predicted residual diagnostics.

#### 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Competition:** Smart India Hackathon (SIH 2026) Prototype
* **Domain:** Disaster Relocation • Geospatial Intelligence • Multi-Agent Systems • Explainable AI

#### 📖 Description
DrishtiSetu is an AI-assisted, GIS-enabled decision support system built for disaster management authorities tackling catastrophic land subsidence, landslides, and flash flooding in vulnerable Himalayan habitations (modeled after the Joshimath crisis in Chamoli district, Uttarakhand). Relocation planning is historically hindered by isolated data silos: GIS hazard maps, structural damage reports, carrying capacity limits, and resettlement regulations rarely interact.

DrishtiSetu synthesizes these disparate streams into a unified executive decision interface. The system employs an agentic orchestration layer that evaluates candidate relocation sites against terrain slope stability, road connectivity, water access, and carrying capacities. A transparent, deterministic scoring engine provides explainable recommendations, ensuring that relocation priorities are backed by traceable evidence rather than black-box algorithms.

15. AUTONOMOUS AI WORKFLOWS & SOCIAL MEDIA PIPELINES
================================================================================
```
* **Title:** Autonomous AI Content Creation & Scheduling Workflows
* **Local Path:** `D:\ProjectsGit\n8n-workflow`
* **GitHub Repository:** [https://github.com/RezZup/n8n-workflows](https://github.com/RezZup/n8n-workflows)
* **Domain:** Workflow Automation • Generative AI Pipelines • Content Automation

#### 📖 Description
A collection of production-ready automation workflows built in n8n for fully autonomous video generation, voice synthesis, and multi-platform distribution. The primary pipeline automates the generation of viral YouTube Shorts from spreadsheet prompts with zero manual intervention.

The pipeline monitors a Google Sheet for new script concepts, invokes Sora 2 / InfiP AI video models to generate high-definition visual clips, synthesizes narration using ElevenLabs voice cloning, synchronizes subtitles and branding through Creatomate API, and schedules completed video assets for automated upload.

#### 🌟 Key Features
- **End-to-End Autonomous Pipeline:** Takes raw text prompts from Google Sheets and outputs fully rendered, voiced videos.
- **Multi-Service AI Integration:** Coordinates Sora 2 (video), ElevenLabs (voice), and Creatomate (video assembly).
- **Sanitized Template Distribution:** Parameterized workflows with credential placeholders safe for public open-source sharing.

#### 🛠️ Tech Stack
n8n Workflow Engine, Google Sheets API, ElevenLabs Voice AI, Creatomate API, Sora 2 / InfiP Video AI, Webhooks, REST APIs.

16. RAKSHAMAP (RITIK) — POSTGIS RELOCATION DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM
================================================================================
```
* **Title:** RAKSHAMAP — Spatial Database & Relocation Decision Engine
* **Local Path:** `D:\ProjectsGit\ritik` / `D:\ProjectsGit\ritik 2\RAKSHAMAP`
* **Domain:** Geospatial Databases • Spatial Relocation • PostGIS • Backend Architecture

#### 📖 Description
RAKSHAMAP provides the robust spatial data foundation for the SIH 26191 disaster relocation platform, piloted on Chamoli district in Uttarakhand. The codebase delivers an enterprise-grade backend architecture built around PostgreSQL and PostGIS, enabling sub-second spatial queries across complex geographic polygons, hazard buffer zones, and habitation coordinates.

The system features reproducible database provisioning via Docker Compose, Alembic schema migrations, and a high-performance FastAPI service exposing geospatial endpoints for slope stability, buffer zone generation, and carrying capacity computation.

#### 🌟 Key Features
- **PostGIS Spatial Modeling:** True spatial queries calculating buffer zones, intersecting hazard polygons, and elevation profiles.
- **Reproducible Infrastructure:** Multi-container Docker Compose environment encompassing PostGIS, FastAPI, and Vite React.
- **Alembic Database Migrations:** Version-controlled database schema management ensuring zero migration drift.
- **Spatial Analytics Endpoints:** RESTful APIs computing slope steepness, road network accessibility, and population density metrics.

#### 🛠️ Tech Stack
PostgreSQL 16, PostGIS 3.4, Python 3.10+, FastAPI, Alembic, Docker Compose, Vite, React, GeoJSON.
